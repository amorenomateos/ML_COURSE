Problem Description:
Employee turnover, also known as "churn," is a significant challenge that organizations worldwide face. It refers to the phenomenon in which employees leave their jobs for various reasons, such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth opportunities, inadequate working conditions, or the pursuit of better opportunities in other companies. Predicting employee turnover is crucial for businesses, as high turnover can be costly and detrimental to productivity and company morale.

Importance of Creating a Prediction Model:
Creating a predictive model for employee turnover is useful for several reasons:

Cost Savings: Employee turnover can be costly for companies in terms of recruitment, training, and loss of productivity. An accurate prediction model allows businesses to identify employees at risk of leaving before they do, enabling them to take preventative measures to retain these employees.

Improved Employee Retention: By identifying the underlying causes of turnover, companies can address specific workplace issues such as job dissatisfaction, lack of growth and development opportunities, or communication problems. This can enhance employee retention and overall job satisfaction.

Workforce Planning: A turnover prediction model enables companies to plan their workforce more effectively. They can anticipate hiring and training needs based on projected turnover rates.

Informed Decision-Making: The data and predictions provided by the model allow company leaders to make informed decisions regarding human resources strategies and labor policies.

Competitiveness and Company Reputation: Retaining talented and committed employees can enhance a company's competitiveness and its reputation as an employer. A low turnover rate can be an attractive factor for attracting new talent.
